# Categorical Data


Categorical variables represent types of data which may be divided into groups. 
Examples of categorical variables are race, sex, age group, and educational level.
While the latter two variables may also be considered in a numerical manner by using
exact values for age and highest grade completed, it is often more informative to 
categorize such variables into a relatively small number of groups.


Analysis of categorical data generally involves the use of data tables. 

A two-way table presents categorical data by counting the number of observations that fall 
into each group for two variables, one divided into rows and the other divided into columns.
For example, suppose a survey was conducted of a group of 20 individuals, who were asked to identify
their hair and eye color. A two-way table presenting the results might appear as follows:


			Eye Color
Hair Color	Blue	Green	Brown	Black	Total		
-----------------------------------------------------
Blonde		2	1	2	1	6
Red		1	1	2	0	4
Brown		1	0	4	2    	7
Black		1	0	2	0	3
-----------------------------------------------------
Total		5	2	10	3   	20

The totals for each category, also known as marginal distributions, provide the number of individuals 
in each row or column without accounting for the effect of the other variable (in the example above,
the total number of individuals with blue eyes, regardless of hair color, is 5).
